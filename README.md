rustychain
==========
A simple blockchain implementation in rust. This is a learning project
with two goals: to learn the intricacies of blockchains and as a first
serious rust project.

The blockchain implementation is heavily based on that of
[bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) with the noticeable
exclusion of the proof-of-work. This simple implementation is intended
to run among (mostly) trusted nodes.

_It appears that someone else has beat me to the 'rustychain' name, so
a rename is likely to happen in the future._
